Most credit the Atari with popularizing microprocessor-based hardware and games stored on ROM cartridges instead of dedicated hardware with games built into the unit. Atari bundled their console with two joystick controllers, a conjoined pair of paddle controllers, and a game cartridge: initially [Combat](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combat_(Atari_2600)>), and later [Pac-Man](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pac-Man_(Atari_2600)>).\n",

The player controls an in-game paddle by moving it vertically across the left or right side of the screen. They can compete against another player controlling a second paddle on the opposing side. Players use the paddles to hit a ball back and forth. The goal is for each player to reach eleven points before the opponent; you earn points when one fails to return it to the other. For the Atari 2600 version of Pong, a computer player (controlled by the Atari 2600) is the opposing player.\n",
