    "# Part 12.2: Introduction to Q-Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "Q-Learning is a foundational technology upon which deep reinforcement learning is based. Before we explore deep reinforcement learning, it is essential to understand Q-Learning. Several components make up any Q-Learning system.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Agent** - The agent is an entity that exists in an environment that takes actions to affect the state of the environment, to receive rewards.\n",
    "- **Environment** - The environment is the universe that the agent exists in. The environment is always in a specific state that is changed by the agent's actions.\n",
    "- **Actions** - Steps that the agent can perform to alter the environment\n",
    "- **Step** - A step occurs when the agent performs an action and potentially changes the environment state.\n",
    "- **Episode** - A chain of steps that ultimately culminates in the environment entering a terminal state.\n",
    "- **Epoch** - A training iteration of the agent that contains some number of episodes.\n",
    "- **Terminal State** - A state in which further actions do not make sense. A terminal state occurs when the agent has one, lost, or the environment exceeds the maximum number of steps in many environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q-Learning works by building a table that suggests an action for every possible state. This approach runs into several problems. First, the environment is usually composed of several continuous numbers, resulting in an infinite number of states. Q-Learning handles continuous states by binning these numeric values into ranges.\n",
    "\n",
    "Out of the box, Q-Learning does not deal with continuous inputs, such as a car's accelerator that can range from released to fully engaged. Additionally, Q-Learning primarily deals with discrete actions, such as pressing a joystick up or down. Researchers have developed clever tricks to allow Q-Learning to accommodate continuous actions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Deep neural networks can help solve the problems of continuous environments and action spaces. In the next section, we will learn more about deep reinforcement learning. For now, we will apply regular Q-Learning to the Mountain Car problem from OpenAI Gym.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introducing the Mountain Car\n",
    "\n",
    "This section will demonstrate how Q-Learning can create a solution to the mountain car gym environment. The Mountain car is an environment where a car must climb a mountain. Because gravity is stronger than the car's engine, it cannot merely accelerate up the steep slope even with full throttle. The vehicle is situated in a valley and must learn to utilize potential energy by driving up the opposite hill before the car can make it to the goal at the top of the rightmost hill.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, it might be helpful to visualize the mountain car environment. The following code shows this environment. This code makes use of TF-Agents to perform this render. Usually, we use TF-Agents for the type of deep reinforcement learning that we will see in the next module. However, TF-Agents is just used to render the mountain care environment for now.\n"

The agent must bin continuous state values into a fixed finite number of columns.\n",

    "- **SHOW_EVERY** How many episodes to allow to elapse before showing an update.\n",
    "- **DISCRETE_GRID_SIZE** How many buckets to use when converting each continuous state variable. For example, [10, 10] indicates that the algorithm should use ten buckets for the first and second state variables.\n",
    "- **START_EPSILON_DECAYING** Epsilon is the probability that the agent will select a random action over what the Q-Table suggests. This value determines the starting probability of randomness.\n",
    "- **END_EPSILON_DECAYING** How many episodes should elapse before epsilon goes to zero and no random actions are permitted. For example, EPISODES//10 means only the first 1/10th of the episodes might have random actions.\n"
