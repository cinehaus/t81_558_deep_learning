    "\n",
    "Human beings learn new skills throughout their entire lives. However, this learning is rarely from scratch. No matter what task a human learns, they are most likely drawing on experiences to learn this new skill early in life. In this way, humans learn much differently than most deep learning projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "A human being learns to tell the difference between a cat and a dog at some point. To teach a neural network, you would obtain many cat pictures and dog pictures. The neural network would iterate over all of these pictures and train on the differences. The human child that learned to distinguish between the two animals would probably need to see a few examples when parents told them the name of each type of animal. The human child would use previous knowledge of looking at different living and non-living objects to help make this classification. The child would already know the physical appearance of sub-objects, such as fur, eyes, ears, noses, tails, and teeth.\n",
    "\n",
    "Transfer learning attempts to teach a neural network by similar means. Rather than training your neural network from scratch, you begin training with a preloaded set of weights. Usually, you will remove the topmost layers of the pretrained neural network and retrain it with new uppermost layers. The layers from the previous neural network will be locked so that training does not change these weights. Only the newly added layers will be trained.\n",
    "\n",
    "It can take much computing power to train a neural network for a large image dataset. Google, Facebook, Microsoft, and other tech companies have utilized GPU arrays for training high-quality neural networks for various applications. Transferring these weights into your neural network can save considerable effort and compute time. It is unlikely that a pretrained model will exactly fit the application that you seek to implement. Finding the closest pretrained model and using transfer learning is essential for a deep learning engineer.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Transfer Learning Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's look at a simple example of using transfer learning to build upon an imagenet neural network. We will begin by training a neural network for Fisher's Iris Dataset. This network takes four measurements and classifies each observation into three iris species. However, what if later we received a data set that included the four measurements, plus a cost as the target? This dataset does not contain the species; as a result, it uses the same four inputs as the base model we just trained.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can take our previously trained iris network and transfer the weights to a new neural network that will learn to predict the cost through transfer learning. Also of note, the original neural network was a classification network, yet we now use it to build a regression neural network. Such a transformation is common for transfer learning. As a reference point, I randomly created this iris cost dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step is to train our neural network for the regular Iris Dataset. The code presented here is the same as we saw in Module 3.\n"
