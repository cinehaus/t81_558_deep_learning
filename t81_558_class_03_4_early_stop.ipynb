    "It can be difficult to determine how many epochs to cycle through to train a neural network. Overfitting will occur if you train the neural network for too many epochs, and the neural network will not perform well on new data, despite attaining a good accuracy on the training set. Overfitting occurs when a neural network is trained to the point that it begins to memorize rather than generalize, as demonstrated in Figure 3.OVER.\n",
