    "Regularization is a technique that reduces overfitting, which occurs when neural networks attempt to memorize training data rather than learn from it. Humans are capable of overfitting as well. Before examining how a machine accidentally overfits, we will first explore how humans can suffer from it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Human programmers often take certification exams to show their competence in a given programming language. To help prepare for these exams, the test makers often make practice exams available. Consider a programmer who enters a loop of taking the practice exam, studying more, and then retaking the practice exam. The programmer has memorized much of the practice exam at some point rather than learning the techniques necessary to figure out the individual questions. The programmer has now overfitted for the practice exam. When this programmer takes the real exam, his actual score will likely be lower than what he earned on the practice exam.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although a neural network received a high score on its training data, this result does not mean that the same neural network will score high on data that was not inside the training set. A computer can overfit as well. Regularization is one of the techniques that can prevent overfitting. Several different regularization techniques exist. Most work by analyzing and potentially modifying the weights of a neural network as it trains.\n",
    "\n",
    "## L1 and L2 Regularization\n",
    "\n",
    "L1 and L2 regularization are two standard regularization techniques that can reduce the effects of overfitting. These algorithms can either work with an objective function or as part of the backpropagation algorithm. The regularization algorithm is attached to the training algorithm by adding an objective in both cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "These algorithms work by adding a weight penalty to the neural network training. This penalty encourages the neural network to keep the weights to small values. Both L1 and L2 calculate this penalty differently. You can add this penalty calculation to the calculated gradients for gradient-descent-based algorithms, such as backpropagation. The penalty is negatively combined with the objective score for objective-function-based training, such as simulated annealing.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will look at linear regression to see how L1 and L2 regularization work. The following code sets up the auto-mpg data for this purpose.\n"
